Output Mapping defines the structure of the final document.

The column_locations data structure is a dictionary that maps table names to another dictionary, which in turn maps column names to their data types or column locations.

For example, the following configures an output mapping to **Postgres**. Here, the table is named fund_performance, and we want 3 columns:
- firm 
- number_of_funds
- commitment
```python output_mapping.py
output_mapping_config = client.configuration.output_mappings.create(
	output_data_type="postgres",
	created_by="user1",
	column_locations={
    	"public.fund_performance": {
        	"firm": "char",
        	"number_of_funds": "char",
        	"commitment": "char"
    	}
	},
	data_locations=["public.fund_performance"]
)
my_output_mapping = output_mapping_config.id
```

This mapping will change depending on the destination:
- If the destination involves an Excel file, then we will require the column locations.

- If the destination is a table, then we require the column type.
    - The following creates an output mapping for postgres.
