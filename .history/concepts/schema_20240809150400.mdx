A schema defines what you want to extract from your document. 

The language model you selected will analyze the document and match the data with the name of the keywords provided.

This means that the name of your keyword doesn't have to exactly match that of the output mapping nor unstructured document.


The following example 
```python add_schema.py
schema_config = client.configuration.schemas.create(
    keywords={
        "Firm": "The name of the firm",
        "Number of Funds": "The number of funds managed by the firm",
        "Commitment": "The commitment amount in millions of dollars",
    },
    created_by="test-user",
)
my_schema = schema_config.id
print(f"Schema ID: {my_schema}")
```
